# Turn-based-Strategy
This was a project founded by [C137Jona](https://github.com/C137-Jona) and [dvdb97](https://github.com/dvdb97)
in order to learn programming and gain some experience with larger projects. Originally, the goal was to develop a turn-based strategy game similar to 
[Civilization V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_V). For this, we used Java and [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/) and tried to implement the graphics from scratch 
using LWJGL's OpenGL wrapper. Given the complexity of the task and the lack of time during our studies, we eventually stopped working on this project. Nowadays, this
repository's sole purpose is to show off the cool graphics we managed to create!

# Graphics Engine

This first image shows our first attempts to render shadows using a very basic 3D model. The gray image to the right shows the light source's [shadow map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mapping).

This is another screenshot taken during the implementation of shadows. This time we created a 3D model of the [Virgental](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgental) since this was closer to what the actual game would have looked like.

# Skyboxes, reflections and ... art?!

This screenshot was taken during our experiments with skyboxes and reflections. The 3D model used here is Blender's [Suzanne](https://www.dummies.com/article/technology/software/animation-software/blender/meet-suzanne-the-blender-monkey-142918/).

![Art](https://github.com/dvdb97/Turn-based-Strategy/blob/master/screenshots/screenshot_2018-12-27-21-24.png)

This piece of art was created by modifying the shader to map all colors to a smaller subset of colors. Looks cool, doesn't it?
