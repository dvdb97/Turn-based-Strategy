# Turn-based-Strategy
This was a project founded by [C137Jona](https://github.com/C137-Jona) and [dvdb97](https://github.com/dvdb97)
in order to learn programming and gain some experience with larger projects. Originally, the goal was to develop a turn-based strategy game similar to 
[Civilization V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_V). For this, we used Java and [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/) and tried to implement the graphics from scratch 
using LWJGL's OpenGL wrapper. Given the complexity of the task and the lack of time because of our studies, we eventually stopped working on this project. Nowadays, this
repository's sole purpose is to show off the cool graphics we managed to create!
